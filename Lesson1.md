## Computer Graphics
- a field of computer science that focuses on the creation, manipulation, and representation of visual images and animations using computers.

## Major Areas of Computer Graphics
1. [Modeling]() refers to the process of creating a mathematical representation of a 3D object or shape.
2. **Rendering** refers to the process of generating an image from a model.
3. **Animation** is the process of creating the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of images or frames.

## Major Applications of Computer Graphics
1. **Video Games** increasingly use sophisticated 3D models and rendering algorithms.
2. **Cartoons** are often rendered directly from 3D models. Many traditional 2D cartoons use backgrounds rendered from 3D models, which allow a continuously moving viewpoint without huge amounts of artist time.
3. **Visual effects** use almost all types of computer graphics technology. Almost every modern film uses digital compositing to superimpose backgrounds with separately filmed foregrounds. Many films also use 3D modeling and animation to create synthetic environments, objects, and even characters that most viewers will never suspect are not real.
4. **Animated films** use many of the same techniques that are used for visual effects, but without necessarily aiming for images that look real.

## Graphics API
- a set of functions that perform basic operations such as drawing images and 3D surfaces into windows on the screen.
- Every graphics program needs to be able to use two related APIs: **a graphics API** for visual output and **a user-interface API** to get input from the user.
